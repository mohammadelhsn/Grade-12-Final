# Grade 12 Final Project

This is my final project for Grade 12 Computer Science. It was built using Python and the `graphics.py` library. The project showcases fundamental object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and uses 2D graphics for a simple visual program.

## üìå Overview

The project involves:
- Drawing shapes and objects using `graphics.py`
- Implementing basic interactivity (e.g. mouse clicks or keyboard inputs)
- Using object-oriented principles like classes and encapsulation
- Applying logic to control the flow and visuals of the program

## üñ•Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- [graphics.py](https://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics/graphics.py) (John Zelle‚Äôs simple graphics library)
